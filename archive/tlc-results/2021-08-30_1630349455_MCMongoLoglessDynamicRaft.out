Finished computing initial states: 15 states generated, with 4 of them distinct at 2021-08-30 14:50:56.
Progress(12) at 2021-08-30 14:50:59: 969,596 states generated (969,596 s/min), 234,042 distinct states found (234,042 ds/min), 158,176 states left on queue.
Progress(15) at 2021-08-30 14:51:59: 36,483,500 states generated (35,513,904 s/min), 4,126,062 distinct states found (3,892,020 ds/min), 1,322,777 states left on queue.
Progress(18) at 2021-08-30 14:52:59: 74,358,297 states generated (37,874,797 s/min), 6,252,392 distinct states found (2,126,330 ds/min), 535,524 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.0E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.7E-5
88150563 states generated, 6788633 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 15 and the 95th percentile is 4).
