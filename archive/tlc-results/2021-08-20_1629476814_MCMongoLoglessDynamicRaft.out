Finished computing initial states: 15 states generated, with 4 of them distinct at 2021-08-20 12:26:56.
Progress(12) at 2021-08-20 12:26:59: 902,636 states generated (902,636 s/min), 221,004 distinct states found (221,004 ds/min), 148,271 states left on queue.
Progress(16) at 2021-08-20 12:27:59: 36,125,573 states generated (35,222,937 s/min), 3,924,904 distinct states found (3,703,900 ds/min), 1,089,471 states left on queue.
Progress(19) at 2021-08-20 12:28:59: 73,646,429 states generated (37,520,856 s/min), 6,012,381 distinct states found (2,087,477 ds/min), 225,876 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.1E-6
78480423 states generated, 6174538 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 15 and the 95th percentile is 4).
