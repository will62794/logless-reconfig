Finished computing initial states: 15 states generated, with 4 of them distinct at 2021-08-23 15:18:55.
Progress(12) at 2021-08-23 15:18:58: 892,598 states generated (892,598 s/min), 216,761 distinct states found (216,761 ds/min), 146,953 states left on queue.
Progress(16) at 2021-08-23 15:19:58: 35,459,105 states generated (34,566,507 s/min), 4,004,451 distinct states found (3,787,690 ds/min), 1,281,238 states left on queue.
Progress(18) at 2021-08-23 15:20:58: 72,638,755 states generated (37,179,650 s/min), 6,147,421 distinct states found (2,142,970 ds/min), 566,628 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.0E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 8.1E-7
88150563 states generated, 6788633 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 15 and the 95th percentile is 4).
