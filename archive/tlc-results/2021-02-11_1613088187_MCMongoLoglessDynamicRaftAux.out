Finished computing initial states: 15 states generated, with 4 of them distinct at 2021-02-11 19:03:08.
Progress(11) at 2021-02-11 19:03:11: 277,891 states generated (277,891 s/min), 80,751 distinct states found (80,751 ds/min), 51,231 states left on queue.
Progress(14) at 2021-02-11 19:04:11: 8,787,542 states generated (8,509,651 s/min), 1,401,424 distinct states found (1,320,673 ds/min), 523,905 states left on queue.
Progress(16) at 2021-02-11 19:05:11: 17,980,017 states generated (9,192,475 s/min), 2,292,350 distinct states found (890,926 ds/min), 552,759 states left on queue.
Progress(17) at 2021-02-11 19:06:11: 27,281,780 states generated (9,301,763 s/min), 3,031,630 distinct states found (739,280 ds/min), 450,576 states left on queue.
Progress(19) at 2021-02-11 19:07:11: 36,927,233 states generated (9,645,453 s/min), 3,503,864 distinct states found (472,234 ds/min), 122,034 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.0E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 8.1E-7
39496507 states generated, 3581233 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 22.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 20 and the 95th percentile is 4).
