If a node was elected in term T in the past, what durable evidence is there of such an election? If there are a quorum of nodes in termâ‰¥ T, this doesn't guarantee that an election actually succeeded in term T. If there exists a log entry in term T, however, this does guarantee that some leader was elected in T since they must have written down that log entry. So, if a log entry exists in term T, then the protocol must be safe against future leaders getting elected in term T again.

Does satisfaction of the WeakQuorumCondition by MongoDynamicRaft rely on many other invariants of the protocol? Is the inductive invariant as complex as the one needed to show StateMachineSafety? The WeakQuorumCondition for elections alone also rely on correctness of the state machine? So it relies on the WeakQuorumCondition for commitment too?

What aspects of the inductive invariant for the static protocol don't depend on strict quorum overlap condition?
