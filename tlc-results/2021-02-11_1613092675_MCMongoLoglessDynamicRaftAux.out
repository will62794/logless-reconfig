Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.8E-4
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 3.3E-5
321405885 states generated, 30257145 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 26.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 20 and the 95th percentile is 4).
